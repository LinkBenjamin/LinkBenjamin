## Greetings, fellow Adventurers!

Hey there, I'm Ben... but owing to the fun of corporate username creation policies, I picked up the moniker 'BLink'.  Then an awesome manager who hired me once wrote my onboarding doc in the style of 'Legend of Zelda' quests (because when you're a nerd *and* you have a last name like 'Link', you're subject to ALL THE PUNZ! ü§£) and later when I decided to do some public dev content, I fused these two thoughts together to establish...

My Adventures are posted to a [DEV blog](https://dev.to/LinkBenjamin) and a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TheAdventuresOfBlink/).  We have a sort of "main quest" consisting of Blog + Youtube releases (Spring and Fall) and then there are "side quest" items like [Advent of Code](https://github.com/LinkBenjamin/adventofcode2024) and blogs about leadership principles, DevOps, agility, and other career-oriented topics.

### About me

I've tried on a lot of wildly different hats within the corporate IT and technology space, from "One-man department" to "Support Technician" to "Data guy" to "(Rogue) Developer" to "System Design Leader" to "Developer Advocate" to "Cloud Analyst".  I've found along the journey that nothing makes me happier than connecting with developers who are building cool stuff and helping them get unblocked.  And have I got stories to tell you... üòè

## Greetings, fellow Adventurers!

Hey there, I'm Ben... but owing to the fun of corporate username creation policies, I picked up the moniker 'BLink'.  Then an awesome manager who hired me once wrote my onboarding doc in the style of 'Legend of Zelda' quests (because when you're a nerd *and* you have a last name like 'Link', you get ALL THE PUNZ! ðŸ¤£) and later when I realized I wanted to do some public Developer-based content, I fused these two thoughts together to establish...

** The Adventures of Blink! **

My Adventures are run through a DEV blog that you can find [here](https://dev.to/LinkBenjamin) and a Youtube channel that you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/@TheAdventuresOfBlink/).  We have a sort of "main quest" which is seasonal Blog + Youtube releases (Spring and Fall) and then there are "side quest" items like [Advent of Code](https://github.com/LinkBenjamin/adventofcode2024) and blogs about leadership principles, DevOps, agility, and other career-oriented topics.
